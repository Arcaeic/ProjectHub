## Projects
I am currently working on a couple other things in the background as well, such as another Reddit bot, and a program that can assist in reviewing writing.
### Programs
 * [PIBot](/PIBot/): 
	* Searches for Personal Information (PI) and reports distrbution to the Reddit mods/admins. Distributing personal information without the person's consent is against Reddit's Terms of Use. I made this bot primarily to practice writing an application in Python, but also because I wanted to write something that could help others.
### [Photoshop](/Photoshop)
* [ADSS Graphics](/Photoshop/Misc/ADSS/)
* [Renders](/Photoshop/Misc/Renders/)
* [Avatars & Profile Pictures](/Photoshop/Avatars/)
* [Forum Signatures](/Photoshop/Forum/)
### [Websites](/Websites/)
* [My First Blog](/Websites/1/)
	* While I was designing this website, I started slowly implementing mySQL and PHP into it. As a result the purpose of this website focused more on learning both design (HTML & CSS), database systems (mySQL), and scripting (PHP).
* [League of Legends Season 3 Watcher](/Websites/2/)
	* The purpose of this website was to follow Riot Game's League of Legends World Championship. Straying away from back-end development and more into front-end, it allows the user to watch the stream via an embedded player, a table consisting of the teams and their regions, an introductory page for those who have not heard of League of Legends, and a bit more.
