## Projects
I am currently taking a condensed Machine Learning course, and have suspended development on some of my projects. My current project is a personal-information detecting Reddit bot. 

### Programs
 * [Crypto-IM App \(SENG360\)](https://github.com/JoryAnderson/University/tree/master/Instant%20Messenger%20App%20(SENG%20360))
    * Establishes a connection between a server/client and allows the two parties to communicate. Options for providing confidentiality (symmetric key encryption), integrity (via Message Authentication Codes), and mutual authentication are included.
    * The included technical manual includes instructions for building/compiling, as well as running the server and client.
    * Created by Jory Anderson, Tim Salomonsson, and Purvika Dutt
 * [PIBot](https://github.com/JoryAnderson/PIBot): 
	* Searches for Personal Information (PI) and reports distrbution to the Reddit mods/admins. Distributing personal information without the person's consent is against Reddit's Terms of Use. I made this bot primarily to practice writing an application in Python, but also because I wanted to write something that could help others.

* [Forum Signatures](/Photoshop/Forum/)
### [Websites](/Websites/)
* [My First Blog](/Websites/1/)
	* While I was designing this website, I started slowly implementing mySQL and PHP into it. As a result the purpose of this website focused more on learning both design (HTML & CSS), database systems (mySQL), and forms, and scripting (PHP).
* [League of Legends Season 3 Watcher](/Websites/2/)
	* The purpose of this website was to follow Riot Game's League of Legends World Championship. Straying away from back-end development and more into front-end, it allows the user to watch the stream via an embedded player, a table consisting of the teams and their regions, and an introductory page for those who have not heard of League of Legends.
