Welcome to my Portfolio! 
## Projects
 * [PIBot](/PIBot/): 
	* Searches for Personal Information (PI) and reports distrbution to the Reddit mods/admins. Distributing personal information without the person's consent is against Reddit's Terms of Use. I made this bot primarily to practice writing an application in Python, but also because I wanted to write something that could help others.
