# Jory's Projects Hub
Hello there! This is is where I host my projects! So far I have created:
* 2 Reddit Bots
	* [PIBot](/PIBot/): Searches for Personal Information (PI) and reports distrbution to the Reddit mods/admins. Distributing personal information without the person's consent is against Reddit's Terms of Use. I made this bot primarily to practice writing an application in Python, but also because I wanted to write something that could help others.
