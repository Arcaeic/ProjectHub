				<span id="content">The holidays are over and I'm working on my website again. I started the about page, as of 					now it's almost completed, we came back to school on the 6th, I was just too lazy to update this page. Today 					I tripped on the stairs outside of the councelling office and right now my right leg isn't feeling good. It 					could be a fracture or sprain, maybe tibia.</span>

				<span id="content">Alot of changes have happened over the month that I haven't posted. The CSS has been 				updated, the S3WB page has been completed, the home page has an OK polish, and the Information page is 					looking good right now, no bugs at the moment. I also fixed the border clipping issue on the home page when 					making the browser smaller.

				<span id="content">So uhh, today I'm going to change the CSS of the front page, it's too coloury compared to 					the rest of the website. I think I'm going to do a simple theme, maybe grey and black.</span>
