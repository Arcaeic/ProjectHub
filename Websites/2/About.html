				<p text-align="center">I created this site to demonstrate using CSS and HTML elements to apply creativity and 					knowledge from study. During September, I caught up on my HTML and CSS. I had prior knowledge for both 					languages, in addition for doing the "Web Fundamentals" course on Codecademy. but I decided to do the new 					course which was provided that covers an updated but similar curriculum.</p>
				<p id="about">As of January 8th, 2014 I now have 809 lines of code, all written from scratch. 
				Another step I could take is to add more to the S3WB page, or somehow integrate PHP onto the website, maybe
				I'll do this next year when I have more time.</p>
