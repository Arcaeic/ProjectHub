====== â€¢ Membrane Potential ======
* Created Monday 09 January 2017

	* The neuron has a Lipid bilayer
	* This precents flow of ions, proteins and other water-soluble molecules
	* [[Membrane Potential]]{{./pasted_image.png}}
	* A nerve cell (cytoplasmic side) will have more negative ions than the extracellular side.
	* Using a voltage amplifier and oscilloscope, we can measure the potential inside the cell.

==== Nongated Ion Channels ====
	**Potassium Channel**
		Outside the cell there is a higher electrical potential (electrical gradient) than inside the cell.
			**Due to this, there is a higher diffusional force for sodium ions from outside to inside the cell. (electrical gradient)**
		Inside the cell, there is a higher potassium concentration (concentration gradient) than outside the cell.
			**Due to this, there is a higher diffusional force for potassium ions from inside to outside the cell. (concentration **
		In both ways, the electricity and concentration want to balance out on either side, but since these forces oppose each other, they can balance.
			Called **Electrochemical Balance**
		Potassium channels allows passage both in/out.
	**Nernst Equation:** Helps find balance of membrane potential between inside/outside of cell.

	**Sodium Channel:**
		Channels sodium out, otherwise the same as potassium channe;/
	**Sodium/Potassium Pump:**
		For 1 molecule of ATP (adenosine triphosphate):
			2 potassium go in
			3 Sodium come out.
		The result is:
			**Concentration Gradient:**
				More sodium outside
				More Potassium inside.
			**Electrical Gradient:**
				Higher potential outside.
