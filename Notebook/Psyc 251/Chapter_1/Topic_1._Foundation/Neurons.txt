* Created Monday 09 January 2017

* **What are Neurons?**
	* Specialized biological cells
	* In the CNS and PNS.
	* Primary Function is information processing (i.e computation) and transmittal

	* Input: Dendrites
	* Output: Axons
	
	* Axon Hillock: Where the axon connects to the cell body.
	* Nodes of Ranvier: The space between the myelin sheaths

==== • Types of Connections Between Synapses: ====
	* **Type 1 (Axosomatic Synpase)**
		* Axons are connected directly to the cell body.
	* **Type 2 (Axodendritic Synapses)**
		* Axons are connected to a dentrite, either to a spine (protruding synapse) or a synapse on the dendritic wall
	* **Type 3 (Axo-axonic Synapse)**
		* Axons are connected to the synapse at the end of the axon.

==== Brainbow Basics: ====
	A single brainbow transgene expresses red, cyan or yellow.
	with multiple brainbow transgenes more colors can be expressed
