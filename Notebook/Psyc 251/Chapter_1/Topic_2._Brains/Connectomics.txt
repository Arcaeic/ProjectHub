The study of connectomes

==== Connectome ====
	* The "wiring diagram" of the brain

==== • Diffusion Tensor/Spectrum Imaging (DTI/DSI) ====
	* Uses MRI to measure diffusion of molecules in brain

==== • Tractography ====
	* Uses DTI/DSI data to trace out connection in brain

===== • DTI/DSI =====
	* Measures the strength and direction of diffusion (and therefore can be represented as vectors)
	* Water molecules diffuse over time
	* In neurons, diffusion tends to occur along the length of axons and dendrites
