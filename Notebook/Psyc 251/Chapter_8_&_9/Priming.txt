=== Priming Summary: ===
	Change in stimulus processing due to prior exposure to same or related stimulus without concious awareness
		Depends on region of cortex processing relevant representations
		**Perceptual Priming:**
			Sensory cortices (occipital lobe for vision, for example)
		**Semantic/Conceptual Priming**
			Unimodal & multimodal association cortices (e.g. anterior teporal, inferior parietal, prefrontal cortex)
