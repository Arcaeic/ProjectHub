===== • Characterizing Attention: =====
* **Source:**
	* **Exogenous:**
		* In the environment, reflexive, automatic, "bottom-up"
	* **Endogenous:**
		* In the mind, voluntary, intentional, "top-bottom"
* **Target:**
	* **External:**
		* Sensory information, in the environment
	* **internal:**
		* Mental representations, in the mind
* **Type:**
	* **Overt **vs **Covert**
	* **Transient **vs **Sustained**
	* **Selective** vs ** Divided**
	

=== • Source: ===
	* The "cause" for directing one's attention
	* **Exogenous (Environment, automatic, etc):**
		* A "salient" stimulus, for example:
			* A loud clap, sharp pain, bright flash, sudden movement
	* **Endogenous (In the mind, voluntary, etc):**
		* A desire, goal, or instruction, ex:
			* What are they talking about?
			* Is this the correct exit from the highway?
			* She told me to focus on the guy with the yellow shirt


=== • Target: ===
	* What you are attending to
	* **External (sensory information, environment):**
		* A sensory modality, spatial location, feature, object, etc
		* The sounds of the forest
		* The back of the classrom
		* The orange shirts of the opposing team
		* The doughnut in the display case
	* **Internal (mental representations, in the mind):**
		* A memory, imagery, or plan
		* A license plate number of a hit and run driver
		* You and your SO relaxing on a tropical island
		* The next step in the recipe.	


=== • Type: ===
	* **Overt **vs **Covert:**
		* **Overt:** Involved actual movement of the sensory surface (moving eyes, directing ears)
		* **Covert: **Does not involve actual movement (peripheral vision, eavesdropping)
	* **Transient **vs **Sustained:**
		* **Transient:** Momentary focus on something (glances at stranger's face)
		* **Sustained:** Prolonged focus on something (guarding a door for 2 hours)
	* **Selective **vs **Divided**
		* **Selective:** Focus on one thing to the exclusion of others (watching TV so intently, you dont notice your friend enter the room)
		* **Divided: **Try to focus on multiple things simultaneously (Talking while driving)
