====== • Event Related Potentials ======
* Created Tuesday 21 February 2017

* **Electroencephalography (EEG)**
	* Non-invasive
	* Measures surface electric fields generated by Post-synaptic potentials in dendrites
	* High temporal resolution: signal sampled > 1000/sec
	* Low spatial resolution: up to 256 (2^8) electrodes

==== • Event-Related Potentials (ERG) ====
	* Averagr of EEG signals
	* Time-locked to event of interest
	* Usually plotted with negative up
