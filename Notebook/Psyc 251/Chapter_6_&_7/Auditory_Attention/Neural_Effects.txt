====== • Neural Effects ======
* Created Tuesday 21 February 2017

* {{./pasted_image.png}}
* **Brainstem evoked responses **show the response from the stimuli in the brainstem/thalamus before being sent to the primary auditory cortex
* **Midlatency Responses **show the response from the stimuli in the auditory cortex before being sent to the secondary/tertiary auditory cortex
* **Late Waves **show the response from the stimuli in the secondary/tertiary cortex before the information is stored.

===== • Attentional Stream Paradigm =====
	* Random sequence of auditory bleeps
	* Occasional deviant targets (different volume/pitch)
	* Instructed to attend to one ear
	
	* Had no effect on brainstem evoked potentials (unattended auditory neurons still fired)
	* However, it had an effect on midlatency potentials
