====== • Behaviour Effects ======
* Created Thursday 23 February 2017

==== • Posner's Spatial Cueing Paradigm ====
	* Maintain central fixation
	* Spatially cued trials
		* 80% valid
		* 20% invalid
	* Neutral Trials
		* No spatial cue
	* Source: Endogenous
	* Target: External
	* Covert
	* Transient
	* Selective

=== • With exogenous source: ===
	* Short cue-to-target intervals (<= 100 ms)
		* Valid cue -> facilitation
	* Long cue-to-target intervals (>= 300 ms)
		* Valid cue -> **Inhibitiion of Return (IoR)**
	* Effects of endogenous and exogenus attention are different
	

=== • With objects ===
	* Participants saw two side-by-sides rectangles
	* A cue was then presented
	* Followed by a target
	* Participants indicated when they saw a target
	* Cue could be:
		* Valid
		* invalid, on same object
		* Invalid, on different object
