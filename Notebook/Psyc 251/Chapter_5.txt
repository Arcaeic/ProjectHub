===== • What is action? =====
	* Change the environment
	* Somatic
		* Skeletal Muscles: Move Limbs
	* Autonomic
		* Smooth muscles:
			* Change blood pressure, digest food
		* Cardiac Muscles:
			* Heartbeat
		* Endocrine Glands:
			* Secrete Hormones
		* Exocrine Glands:
			* Secrete sweat, saliva, etc.
	* Internal to CNS?
		* Update memory, switch tasks, etc


==== • Action ====
	* Problem:
		* How to affect change in the world
	* Importance:
		* Necessary to achieve goals (eat, drink, reproduce, survive,...)
	* Challenge:
		* The inverse problem: Determining what actopns to take in order to achieve goals


==== • Inverse and Forward Models ====
	* Inverse Models:
		* Current Position & Desired Position
			* -> Motor Commands
		* Used to create motor plans
	* Forward Models"
		* Current Position & Motor Commands
			* -> Predicted Position
		* Used to eval. motor plans / action


==== • Feedforward and Feedback Control ====
	* Feedforward Control
		* Motor commands sent to muscle
		* Faster, less accurate
	* Feedback control
		* Motor command sent to muscle
		* Actual state compared to desired state
		* Adjustments based on errors
		* Slower, more accurate
